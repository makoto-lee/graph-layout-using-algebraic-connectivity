## Graph Layout using Algebraic Connectivity

This program is trying to layout a graph in graph theorem, by adding some 'spring' as the edges in this graph, and the repulsive force computed from algebraic connectivity.

This program is avalible at [here](https://makoto-lee.github.io/p5/draw_graph_theory/). And github repository at [there](https://github.com/makoto-lee/graph-layout-using-algebraic-connectivity)

For more details and explains in [full-README](https://hackmd.io/@EWx9gzUbSg-mpTIcL2mJsg/BykIeuv1j)
